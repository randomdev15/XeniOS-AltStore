<h1 align="center">XeniOS - Xbox 360 Emulator</h1>

XeniOS is an experimental Apple-focused fork of Xenia, currently based on
[Xenia Edge](https://github.com/has207/xenia-edge). It exists as a fast-moving
place to develop, test, and ship iOS and macOS work while also carrying
platform changes that benefit ARM64 Windows, Linux, and Android. Relevant
improvements are intended to flow back upstream over time.

## Current Focus

- iOS
- macOS (Apple Silicon)
- macOS (Intel)

Current published releases focus on iOS and macOS.
For Windows or Linux builds, use [Xenia Edge](https://github.com/has207/xenia-edge) or [Xenia Canary](https://github.com/xenia-canary/xenia-canary).

## Why This Fork Exists

Xenia development is relatively thinly staffed right now, and upstream is not
set up for fast iteration on Apple-specific packaging, documentation, release
flow, and user experience. XeniOS exists so that work can move faster in a
repository where the full product experience can be shaped directly, from the
app itself to releases, docs, compatibility reporting, and the public website
at [xenios.jp](https://xenios.jp).

The goal is not to keep good work siloed here forever. The goal is to iterate
quickly, build a more polished user-facing experience for Apple platforms, and
then contribute the useful technical improvements back upstream into the
broader Xenia community, especially
[Xenia Canary](https://github.com/xenia-canary/xenia-canary).
